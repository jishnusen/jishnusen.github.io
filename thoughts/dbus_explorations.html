<h1>(Python) DBUS Explorations</h1>

<h2>why...</h2>
<p>
I was faced with what should be a simple task&mdash; running a script before and
after a machine goes to sleep. Why? Not every laptop's power management is
created equal, and often things need to be shut down explicitly, like bluetooth.
SystemD provides a relatively simple way to do this, in the form of the
<code>sleep</code> target. Scripts that run depending on this target can be
placed in <code>/lib/systemd/system-sleep/</code>.
</p>

<p>
For example, to forcibly shut off bluetooth on suspend, and turn it back on
during resume, one could create the following script:
</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

PATH=/usr/bin
case "$1" in
  pre)
    rfkill block bluetooth
    ;;
  post)
    rfkill unblock bluetooth
    ;;
esac
exit 0
</pre>

<p>
Now, if you're doing this for practical reasons stop here, since this is the
recommended method for user-defined hacks. The warning message in the manpage is
pretty scary:
</p>
<pre>
Note that scripts or binaries dropped in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/ are
intended for local use only and should be considered hacks. If applications want
to react to system suspend/hibernation and resume, they should rather use the
Inhibitor interface.
</pre>

<p>
But the script in the example, and similar ones, are examples of these local
uses, so they are probably what you should be doing. However, seeing this
warning message evokes the natural curiosity: what exactly is the inhibitor
interface, and how can I use it? (Overengineering is fun)
</p>

<h2>inhibitors</h2>
<p>
For the curious, the complete documentation for the inhibitor interface can be
found <a
  href=https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/inhibit/>here</a>.
The documentation provides a handy bit of pseudo-code, that does pretty much
what we want to accomplish. It runs a function before the computer goes to
sleep, and then runs another function when the computer wakes up. I've copied it
here for your convenience:
</p>
<pre>
int fd = -1;

takeLock() {
        if (fd >= 0)
                return;

        fd = Inhibit("sleep", "Word Processor", "Save any unsaved data in time...", "delay");
}

onDocumentOpen(void) {
        takeLock();
}

onPrepareForSleep(bool b) {
        if (b) {
                saveData();
                if (fd >= 0) {
                        close(fd);
                        fd = -1;
                }
         } else
                takeLock();

}
</pre>

<p>
Although the pseudo-code is nice, we have to implement it of course! DBus is
pretty complicated; but the parts we need to understand for this exercise can be
distilled down pretty simply.
</p>

<h2>what's dbus</h2>
<p>
The so-called "hacky" solution I presented at the
start of this uses "SystemD", an init system and framework present on most linux
distributions. As an init system, SystemD owns all the processes running on
the computer, so it is only natural for it to be the one to initiate suspending
and resuming the computer. SystemD is tightly integrated with a message bus
called "DBus". Most of the behaviors of SystemD are dependent on messages in
DBus, and many SystemD services emit their own messages. Before we go on, let's
set some DBus terminology straight:

<ul>
  <li>Object: an arbitrary object in memory that DBus is somewhat aware of</li>
  <li>Object Path: a string that looks like a filesystem path that provides
    bindings to these objects. Think of this like a "process ID" to identify the
    instance of the object.</li>
  <li>Interface: each object has a set of interfaces. This is the canonical OOP
    object, which comes with its equivalent of methods and variables (messages).
  <li>Method: methods of a DBus object that can be called via their
    corresponding path</li>
  <li>Signal: messages emitted by a DBus object. Each "Signal" is a single
    message</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>the sleep dbus object</h2>
<p>
Perusing over the inhibitor interface reveals that the <code>Inhibit</code>
function that we see in the example are part of a set of interfaces in the
<code>org.freedesktop.login1</code> object, at the
<code>/org/freedesktop/login1</code> path.
Finally, these are part of the <code>org.freedesktop.login1.Manager</code>
interface. This is presented in the docs pretty clearly, and they include a full
dump of the object looks like this (I trimmed a lot out, reference the linked
documentation if you want to see mroe of the object, or just run the command
yourself),
</p>
<pre>
$ gdbus introspect --system --dest org.freedesktop.login1 --object-path /org/freedesktop/login1
node /org/freedesktop/login1 {
  interface org.freedesktop.login1.Manager {
    methods:
      Inhibit(in  s what,
              in  s who,
              in  s why,
              in  s mode,
              out h fd);
      ...
    signals:
      PrepareForSleep(b active);
      ...
  };
  ...
};
</pre>
<p>
From the previous section, you probably recognize the object path, as well as
interfaces, methods, and signals in this output. Now, we have the tools to
leverage any dbus library in a language that understands these semantics.
</p>

<h2>implementation</h2>
<h3>Inhibit</h3>
<p>
The docs state that the <code>Inhibit</code> method returns a file descriptor
that corresponds to the inhibition. Once this file descriptor is closed by the
owning process, SystemD will allow the computer to sleep. To use it, let's use
the <a href=https://pypi.org/project/dbus-python/><code>dbus-python</code></a>
python library. First, we need to get the bus object, and then take its
<code>Manager</code> interface, which we do like so:
</p>

<pre>
object = dbus.SystemBus().get_object("org.freedesktop.login1", "/org/freedesktop/login1")
interface = dbus.Interface(object, "org.freedesktop.login1.Manager")
</pre>

<p>
Pretty nice! The library is a very semantically accurate interpretation of the
DBus spec, and everything is named just as we would think. Now, all that remains
is to call the actual <code>Inhibit</code> method, which we can do as if it is a
python object:
</p>

<pre>
fd = interface.Inhibit("sleep", ...).take()
</pre>

<p>
Note that <code>dbus-python</code> wraps file descriptors like the one returned by
<code>Inhibit</code> in a <code>UnixFd</code> object, which is an abstraction over
actual file descriptor number to prevent things like leaking file descriptors or
other issues. To actually open the file descriptor ourselves, we need to call
the <code>take()</code> method ourselves. I've done this on the same line to
prevent passing around an unopened file descriptor which is effectively
meaningless.
</p>

<h3>PrepareForSleep</h3>
<p>
At this point, we're inhibiting sleep. But, since our goal is just running a
script before sleeping, we ened to release our inhibition. To do so, we listen
for the PrepareForSleep signal. As we learned earlier, DBus signals are emitted
often by SystemD targets/services, and in this case, the PrepareForSleep method
is emmitted once the user requests the computer to sleep. Somewhat
unintuitively, it is also emitted on wakeup. That's why the message contains the
field <code>b active</code>. The <code>b</code> here is a particularly terse
notation of the boolean type. To listen for this signal, we can once again
leverage <code>dbus-python</code>:
</p>

<pre>
dbus.SystemBus().add_signal_receiver(lambda active: if active: os.close(fd) else ...,
                                     signal_name="PrepareForSleep",
                                     dbus_interface="org.freedesktop.login1.Manager")
</pre>

<p>
The parameters are pretty obvious here&mdash; we listen for the
<code>PrepareForSleep</code> signal on our interface. The first argument is a
function that is called with the messages properties as arguments. In our case,
it's the <code>b active</code> parameter. So, if <code>active</code> is true,
the computer wants to go to sleep, so we close the inhibitor. Of course, you'll
want to actually run the script here. And otherwise, you'll want to grab the
inihibitor again! A more complete handler might look like this:
</p>

<pre>
def handle_sleep(active):
  if active:
    os.system("rfkill block bluetooth")
    os.close(fd)
    fd = -1
  elif not fd > 0:
    fd = interface.Inhibit("sleep", ...).take()
</pre>

<h3>complete</h3>
<p>
For all of this to actually work, we need to set up a DBus object in order to
receive signals. This part is pretty simple, and we use <code>dbus-python</code>
once more, combined with another library <a
  href=https://pypi.org/project/PyGObject/><code>PyGObject</code></a> That
provides bindings to make a GObject, which is a pretty simple DBus object. In
our case, we use it like so:
</p>

<pre>
from gi.repository import GLib
from dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop

# Set the main loop
DBusGMainLoop(set_as_default=True)
# Setup the listener here _after_ the library is aware of the object
dbus.SystemBus().add_signal_receiver(...)
# Start the object
loop = GLib.MainLoop()
loop.run()
</pre>

<p>
Note that once we call <code>loop.run()</code>, our python program has
transformed into a DBus object listening to the PrepareForSleep signal. In other
words, the function is blocking!
</p>

<h2>conclusion</h2>
<p>
DBus is pretty powerful. In this example, we see how it can be used to transform
programs into a live ABI. In this case, one might imagine the
<code>login1</code> DBus object to be a part of the system ABI, with the Inhibit syscall
provided. These are tightly integrated with a publisher/subscriber messaging
model in the form of signals. By integrating objects themselves with the
messaging platform a lot of powerful patterns emerge, that make DBus much
preferable to basic Unix sockets in many cases. Of course, with this
powerfulness comes great complexity, and this post only scratches the surface of
what's possible with DBus.
